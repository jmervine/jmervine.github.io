## Joshua P. Mervine

Technical leader with over twenty years of experience. Currently focused on
reliability, compliance, automation and tooling. Experience includes development
leadership and architecture, process management and project management, application
design and development, release process and automation and systems
engineering. Strengths include communication, collaboration, problem solving,
as well as mentoring and leading technical staff.

I want to create useful things for useful people, and in doing so help useful
people become more useful.

## Specialties

If you're looking for all the buzz words or to have a discussion about algorithms,
I'm probably not the right candidate for you. I specialize in learning what I
need to know to solve the problem at hand.

That said, if you need the buzz words, here's a few.

* Operating Systems: Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS, Redhat, etc.
* Languages: Ruby, Golang, JavaScript (Node.js and client), Python, etc.
* Applications/Tools: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Git, Nginx, Splunk, etc.
* Development Processes: Agile/Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall; whatever fits for the
  team at hand and delivers.

## Experience - Open Source Projects (a.k.a Nights and Weekends)

Over the last few years, I've worked quite actively on several open source
projects, some by contract and some just for fun. Aside from the highlighted
project below, have a ton of stuff on [Github](https://github.com/jmervine),
as I use it as a bit of a scratch directory.

### BootstrapCDN

[BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) is an open source web site, focused
on easily and reliably deliver [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) client design
framework to the public in a free and open source capacity. I work closely with
the developers of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
and [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), delivering updates and site enhancements
as necessary.

### json2struct.mervine.net

[json2struct.mervine.net](https://json2struct.mervine.net/) is a small extension
to [github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson) that I
created to bring a easy to use web interface to the project. Unlike many other side
projects, it has gained some traction and sees a fair amount of use.
